    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Cereal, although quite simple, is a timeless dish consumed primarily at midnight or mornings.</p>
    <p>Throughout time, something has additionally stayed consistent, about 50% of the population 
        seems to make the dish backwards, <em><strong>completely</strong></em> backwards!</p>
    <p>Please follow the ordered directions exactly and without compromise! :D</p>
